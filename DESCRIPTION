Description: Given a known depths and known (or modelled) ages, it is
  often convenient to approximate age as a function of depth in an archive. This
  package provides tools to flexibly create age-depth relationships with various rules
  for interpolating age within known age-depth values, and extrapolating above and below
  these values.
